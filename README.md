# PentestBox
This repository contains tools to create a 2GB SD card image based upon latest arch sources including all dependencies for PentestBox. PentestBox is a fork of the Piratebox project, intended for use by penetration testers and designed for security.

# Build the Image Automatically
Run ./build.sh.  The build script will ask some simple questions.  It will then install required dependencies and build the PentestBox image automagically.  

# Building The Image Manually

## Required Tools
On Debian based systems simply run:
```Bash
sudo apt-get install pv qemu-system-arm qemu-user-static zip
```
Running **make** will acquire all dependencies, install PirateBox and package the image for distribution:
```Bash
make
```
By default this target builds the image for the *RPi 1* to build the image for *RPi 2* simply pass the *ARCH* variable:

```Bash
make ARCH=rpi2
```

There is a script in place that will build the images for *RPi 1 and RPi 2*, simply invoke:
```Bash
./old_build_all.sh
```

The resulting zip files are stored in a freshly created folder "images".

### Packaging the images
To zip the image simply invoke the dist target:
```Bash
make dist
```

## Versioning Scheme
The versioning scheme of the image is like so:

```
pentestbox_${arch}_${version}-${buildnum}.img.zip
```

Each parameter is described below.

## Available make Parameters
You can pass different parameters to the build script, lets describe them briefly.

### ARCH
May be *rpi1* or *rpi2*, defaults to **rpi1**.

### BUILD
Number of the build. Leave empty for a date stamp. Defaults to **date stamp**

### VERSION
Used piratebox version in format **x.y.z**, defaults to **devBuild**

### SOURCE
May be *piratebox* or *librarybox*, defaults to **piratebox**

### BRANCH
The branch of *piratebox-ws* used, defaults to **master**.

## Accessing Image via chroot
To access the image via chroot simply mount the image by invoking
```Bash
make mount_image
```

In case you need network access within the chroot mount proc to the mounted image:
```Bash
sudo mount -t proc proc /mount/root/proc/
```

Then chroot into the environment:
```Bash
sudo chroot /mount/root/
```

Do not forget to unmount the image when you are done:
```Bash
make umount_image
```

## Testing via Qemu
After the image is build it may be run in QEMU by invoking the helper script:
```Bash
cd qemu-arm-rpi
./rpi.sh /path/to/piratebox.img
```
This only works with the RPi 1 image.

## Dumping image to SD card
To dump the raw image to an SD card run:
```Bash
sudo dd if=piratebox-rpi.img bs=2048 | pv | sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=2048
sync
```

## Supported Platforms by image
There are only two images needed to support all different Raspberry Pi boards.

### piratebox-rpi.img
* Raspberry Pi 1 A
* Raspberry Pi 1 A+
* Raspberry Pi 1 B
* Raspberry Pi 1 B+
* Raspberry Pi Zero
* Raspberry Pi Zero W

### piratebox-rpi2.img
* Raspberry Pi 2 B
